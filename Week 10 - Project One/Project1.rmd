# Introduction
In this project, we will analyze survey data collected from classmates to gain insights into their financial habits and situations, including budgeting methods, spending patterns, saving behaviors, and concerns about debt. Weâ€™ll conduct data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns within financial practices. Using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and inferential analysis, we aim to highlight relationships between financial behaviors and various factors that may influence financial decision-making. This analysis will provide a deeper understanding of the financial habits and challenges among our peers.

## Load Data & Basic Cleaning
```{r}
# Load the DataFrame
df = read.csv("ProData.csv", header = TRUE)

# Remove Unnecessary Rows
df = df[-c(1, 2), ]

# Select Needed Cols
cols = c("RecordedDate", "LocationLatitude", "LocationLongitude", "Question.One.", "Question.Two._1", "Question.3.", "Question.4_1", "Question.5", "Question.6", "Question.7", "Question.8", "Question.9", "Question.10", "Question.11")
df = df[, cols]
df = df %>%
  rename(
    Date_Recorded = RecordedDate,
    Latitude = LocationLatitude,
    Longitude = LocationLongitude,
    Budget_Management_Method = Question.One.,
    Financial_Confidence = Question.Two._1,
    Student_Loans = Question.3.,
    Student_Debt_Concern = Question.4_1,
    Future_Financial_Decision_Impact = Question.5,
    Biggest_Expense = Question.6,
    Employment_Status = Question.7,

    Saving_For_Retirement = Question.9,
    Financial_Independence_Confidence = Question.10,
    Job_Confidence_Post_Graduation = Question.11
  )

# Display First Few Rows
df
```

## Further Cleaning
```{r}
# Convert Cols to Ints where Needed
df = df %>%
  mutate(across(c(Latitude, Longitude, Financial_Confidence, Student_Debt_Concern), as.numeric))

# Convert Response to DT
df$Date_Recorded = as.Date(df$Date_Recorded)

# Convert Binary Responses to 1/0 For Analysis
df = df %>%
  mutate(
    Student_Loans = ifelse(trimws(tolower(Student_Loans)) == "yes", 1, 0),
    Financial_Independence_Confidence = ifelse(trimws(tolower(Financial_Independence_Confidence)) == "confident", 1, 0),
    Job_Confidence_Post_Graduation = ifelse(trimws(tolower(Job_Confidence_Post_Graduation)) == "confident", 1, 0),
    Saving_For_Future_Expenses = ifelse(trimws(tolower(Saving_For_Future_Expenses)) == "yes", 1, 0),
    Saving_For_Retirement = ifelse(trimws(tolower(Saving_For_Retirement)) == "yes", 1, 0)
  )

# Function to calculate the mode
get_mode = function(x) {
  unique_x = na.omit(x)  # Remove NA values
  unique_x[which.max(tabulate(match(x, unique_x)))]
}

# Replace NAs with mode for each column
df = df %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ ifelse(is.na(.), get_mode(.), .)))

# Re-Display Dataframe
head(df)
```
