## Course Overview

The course, **Math 3210: Applied Statistical Computing and Multivariate Methods**, introduces students to common applied multivariate statistical methods and techniques, including:
- Data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Dimensionality reduction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis).
- Hypothesis testing and statistical inference.
- Applied machine learning with a focus on classification and prediction.

Students work extensively with **R** and **SAS**, analyzing datasets and solving real-world data problems.

## Projects and Lab Assignments

### Lab Assignment 10: PCA Analysis on the MTCars Dataset
- **Objective**: Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the **mtcars** dataset to reduce dimensionality, visualize the principal components, and detect outliers.
- **Key Techniques**: PCA, scree plot, biplots, and outlier detection.
- **Dataset**: [mtcars](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html)

### Lab Assignment 9: Air Pollutant Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze air pollutant levels in the USA for **Carbon Monoxide (CO)** and **Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)** over multiple years.
- **Key Techniques**: Data wrangling, time series analysis, and median calculations.
- **Dataset**: [Daily CO and SO2 pollutant levels](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb29449106)

### Lab Assignment 5: Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on air quality and socioeconomic data, uncovering trends and relationships.
- **Key Techniques**: Data cleaning, outlier detection, scatterplots, and numerical summaries.
- **Dataset**: Air quality and socioeconomic data for different counties.

### Lab Assignment 3: Loops and Conditional Statements
- **Objective**: Use loops and conditional statements in R to process and analyze simulated environmental sensor data.
- **Key Techniques**: `for` loops, `while` loops, conditional statements.
- **Dataset**: Simulated sensor readings over a 24-hour period.

### Additional Projects:
- **Lab Assignment 4**: Survey data analysis using R to clean and manipulate survey responses.
- **Lab Assignment 2**: Functions and loops for calculating sums of even and odd numbers.
- **Lab Assignment 7**: Data manipulation using advanced dplyr techniques on datasets like PeopleData, TransactionsData, and EmployeeData.
